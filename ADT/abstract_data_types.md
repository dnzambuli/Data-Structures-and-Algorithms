# ADT
- a collection of data 
- operations that can be don on the data 
## Features
1. **Modularity** - keeping complex large programs manageable by systematically controlling the interactions of its components
- helps isolate errors
- helps eliminate redundancies
- Makes it easier to write
- Read
- and, Modify
2. **Functional Abstraction** - separates functionality from implementation 
***module specification*** - how a program functions independent of its implementation
***information hiding*** - making details of implementation inaccessible from outside the module
3. **Data Abstraction** - what you do to a collection independent of how you do it
***in short*** an extension of functional abstraction
## Operations
- add data to a collection
- remove data from a collection
- ask about the data within the collection
## Specifications
- what the ADT operations do
- not how they do it
## Implementaton
- choosing a data structure
